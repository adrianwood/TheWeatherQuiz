9,Where in the world is the highest average annual rainfall?,2,2,8411mm,3824mm,11878mm,18386mm,C,1,On average a total of 11872mm (467.4 inches) is recorded annually in Mawsynram India. 
10,What is the lowest recorded annual rainfall amount?,2,2,0mm,5mm,15mm,20mm,A,1,The Atacama Desert is located in northern Chile and reaches a small part of southern Peru. A high pressure cell over the Pacific keep back moisture from the west while the mountains block clouds formed in the Amazon Basin from the east. On the coast the cold water Peru Current coming from Antarctica chills the desert air further inhibiting the rain clouds. The average annual rainfall is about 25 mm and in some mid-deserts spots but in the Antofagasta region of the Atacma desert no rain has never been recorded at least as long as humans have measured it!
11,How often does sunspot activity peak?,1,1,every 5 years,every year,every 11 years,every 22 years,C,1,Sunspots are the cooler regions on the sun's surface and the number of them varies over a period of 22 years with a maximum or minimum reached every 11 years. Our weather patterns are determined by how much of the sun's radiation reaches different parts of the planet. The atmosphere is heated unevenly and this drives the movement of air masses leading to the changes in the weather we experience. 
12,Why do seasons happen?,1,2,The tilt of the Earth's rotation axis relative to the plane which it orbits around the sun,The variations in the distance the Earth is from the sun,The variations in the number of sunspots,The effects of the moon's gravity,A,1,Seasons happen as a result of the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth on its axis relative to the plane that we orbit the sun. At opposite times of the year e.g. June and December one side of our planet is tilted towards the sun while the other side is tilted away. This creates a large difference in the amount of heating from the sun and leads to us experiecing summer in one hemisphere and winter in the other. 
13,The summer in the northern hemisphere is on average hotter than the summer in the southern hemisphere. Why is this?,1,3,The difference in the distance between the Earth and the sun,The amount of ice on Antarctica,There is more land in the Northern hemisphere,The effects of the moon's gravity,C,1,There is much more land in the Northern hemisphere. When the sun's radiation hits the land a greater amount is reflected back to the atmosphere heating the air more than when it hits the water. However the amount of water in your local region has a far greater influence on how hot the summer is than the hemisphere you live in.  
14,What is the main gas in the atmosphere?,1,1,Oxygen,Nitrogen,Carbon Dioxide,Methane,B,1,Nitrogen makes up 78% of the atmosphere followed by Oxygen at 21% and then Argon at 0.9%
15,Which layer of the atmosphere is closest to the Earth's surface?,1,2,Mesosphere,Exosphere,Stratosphere,Troposphere,D,1,The Troposphere stretches from the Earth's surface to about 10km at high lattitudes and to about 18km at lower lattitudes.
16,Which climate zone is the UK in?,3,2,tropical,temperate,subtropical/ arid,Polar,B,1,Temperate climates have an average temperature in the coldest months of between -3 and 18°C and over 10°C in the warmest month. They are characterised by a wet summer of winter or are wet all year. 
17,What is the Gulf stream?,3,2,A cold ocean current,A cold air mass,A warm ocean current,A warm air mass,C,1,The Gulf stream is a powerful warm and fast ocean current that travels North from the Eastern tip of Florida following the Eastern US States before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. At around 40°0′N 30°0′W it splits into two. The Northern stream moves towards Northern Europe and the Southern stream towards West Africa. The climate of Northern and Western Europe is warmer because of this ocean current than it would be otherwise. 
18,What is the jet stream?,3,1,A narrow band of fast flowing air high up in the atmosphere,An air mass,A warm ocean current ,A cold ocean current,A,1,The jet stream is a narrow band of fast flowing air high up in the atmosphere around the level of the tropopause (approx 11km at the poles and 17km at the equator). It flows at around 160 km/hour and has a strong influence on the weather in the UK. 
19,What does a barometer measure?,4,1,temperature,rainfall,Atmospheric pressure,humidity,C,1,Mercury barometers measure air pressure. The level of the mercury in the column varies with the air pressure above it. High air pressure leads to a rise in the mercury level. 
20,What does an anemometer measure?,4,2,Rainfall,Wind speed and direction,Air pressure,Humidity,B,1,Anemometers measure wind speed and direction in metres per second or knots. It includes cups which catch the wind and rotate. The speed they rotate at is averaged over a few minutes. The wind direction is measured by a wind vane designed to point into the flow. 
21,Between 1906 and 2005 how much did the global average surface temperature rise by?,5,3,0.21°C,0.34°C,0.65°C,0.74°C,D,1,The global average surface temperature rose by 0.74°C between 1906 and 2005. Much of this amount was in the last 50 years and scientists have proven beyond doubt that the planet is warming. 
22,Which one of these is not a greenhouse gas?,5,2,Water vapour,Carbon Dioxide,Helium,Methane,C,1,Helium is the only one that isn't a greenhouse gas. The main greenhouse gases are water vapour methane and carbon dioxide which act to absorb some of the heat that would otherwise be reflected back out to space.
